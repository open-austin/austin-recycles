# factory_girl supports generating model instances using a factory pattern.
# Note that the major version of factory_girl that you need is dependent upon
# the version of ruby you are using.
#
# There are no rake tasks, just gem dependencies.
#
# add to your .gemspec:
#   gem.add_development_dependency('factory_girl', '~> 2.0')  if RUBY_VERSION =~ %r{^1\.8\.}
#   gem.add_development_dependency('factory_girl', '~> 3.0')  if RUBY_VERSION =~ %r{^1\.9\.}
